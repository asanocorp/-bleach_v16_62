## [#bleach_v16_62](http://_bleach_v16_62.surge.sh/)

[![#bleach_v16_62 poster image][1]](http://_bleach_v16_62.surge.sh/)

is an interactive story taking place in near and dark future on european continent. it was hacked together by [we are the playMakers](https://github.com/weAreThePlayMakers) as a complimentary feat to [#transeuropacaravans](http://citizenspact.eu/) an awesome initiative by [european alternatives](http://www.euroalter.com/) taking place across europe.

as a preview/teaser: [http://bleachv1662.businesscatalyst.com/](http://bleachv1662.businesscatalyst.com/) materials from work on character-sheets-app pasted together with suitable narrative

to see heavy-client demo click the graphic above or [_bleach_v16_62.surge.sh](http://_bleach_v16_62.surge.sh/).

remember it is a client demo which means:

- it was our initiative
- made outside of working hours
- on a crazy schedule
- never made it to production as the crews drove off

the result is pretty neat anyway despite:

- overuse of poor quality gif files (which need to go)
- large size (loadable only thanks to god knows what)
- lack of any ux considerations (so remember to click the button in the lower right while you are watching the thing)

so without any more b******* i give you [#bleach_v16_62](http://_bleach_v16_62.surge.sh/)

there is no ui so to speak and you swap pages using an icon in the lower right corner.

make sure you read hover over the cards on the last page to see the credits.

update 2015:

ignore the text below as the composition is hosted with surge.sh

thanks

# * * * update * * *

the pilot, which so far is the real thing has to be [downloaded as a .zip](https://github.com/rafszul/-bleach_v16_62/archive/master.zip), unpacked and run in the browser (we talking: bleach_v16_62-005-3.html)

i left it off unoptimised and overloaded with unneceseary gif files with clear difference where prototype uses pngs made from svgs which i would want to use. since we had little time to play as [#transeuropacaravans](http://citizenspact.eu/) was setting off i left it with no optimising, smoothing up etc

btw firefox does not support advanced css filters so it might not display the real thing but i am not sure how big the difference does it make

# * * * update * * *

publishing adobe edge comps on wordpress multisite bogged down our simple and apparently rapid workflow.

i never felt like i had the time to look into it and there were multiple possibilities as to whys and wherefores

i guess a most issues were due to file size of the final comp (40mgb) which is pretty rich for a slideshow with music purporting to be an alternate reality multiplayer game ;-)

there was not enough time though and finding ourselves with reduced capability for creation of text and graphical content we still managed to cover some ground

some parts are reusable so now they are part of our "lorem ipsum gallery"

here iframe test on wordpress with link to a preview of project codio box

works surprisingly well considering no opt but it runs via link to preview from codio box



page turn in lower right corner of the comp

http://_bleach_v16_62.surge.sh/ - it might not kick start and get stuck on loading screen in which case copy the link and try all the browsers you have

if no success and you are really keen on seeing it (and it's worth it even if just for the music ;-)) then either download the whole comp or drop me a line and i will arange a private viewing for you ;-)

thanks and good luck
