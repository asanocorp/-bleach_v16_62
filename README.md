# #bleach_v16_62 

is an interactive story taking place in near and dark future on european continent. it was hacked together by [we are the playMakers](http://wearetheplaymakers.com/) as a complimentary feat to [#transeuropacaravans](http://citizenspact.eu/) an awesome initiative by [european alternatives](http://www.euroalter.com/) 

as a preview: [http://bleachv1662.businesscatalyst.com/](http://bleachv1662.businesscatalyst.com/) materials from work on characters and character-sheet creation pasted together with suitable narrative

the pilot, which so far is the real thing has to be [downloaded as a .zip](https://github.com/rafszul/-bleach_v16_62/archive/master.zip), unpacked and run in the browser (we talking: bleach_v16_62-005-3.html)

i left it off as is and have no inclination to get back to untill needed so no optimising, smoothing up etc 

btw firefox does not support advanced css filters so it might not display the real thing but i am not sure how big the difference does it make

the issues with publishing adobe edge comps on wordpress multisite i had during work on diasporachangemakers.net and neighbours.org was a massive issue for simple and apparently rapid workflow.

i never felt like i had the time to look into it and there were multiple possibilities as to whys and wherefores 

since we resolved github is the best immediately available and fairly accessible tool that could become replacement to all the years of socialisation and structure building known i had the web version there but weren't really doing anything with it

it gave me loads of headaches published via business catalyst but i think this was mainly result of the file size (40mgb) which is pretty rich for a slideshow with music purporting to be an alternate reality multiplayer game.

there was not enough time though and finding ourselves with reduced capability for creation of text and graphical content we still managed to cover some ground

some parts are reusable so now they are part of our "lorem ipsum gallery"

here iframe test on wordpress with link to a preview of project codio box 

works surprisingly well considering no opt but it runs via link to preview from codio box
